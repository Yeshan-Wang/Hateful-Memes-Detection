# Hateful-Memes-Detection
This repository contains all code that has been used for my thesis project. The project aims to explore the impact of data augmentation, feature extraction by image captioning, text encoder selection, and ensemble learning on hateful meme detection.

# Preparation before reproducing all codes

## Data 
The dataset used for my thesis project is the Facebook Hateful Memes Dataset, which is the largest annotated memes dataset that contains more than 10K memes with gold labels. Since the dataset contains some offensive and distasteful memes that may be disturbing to some people, Facebook AI Research strictly restrict the dissemination of this dataset. Anyone who wants to use this dataset for academic research must fill out a form and agree to the dataset license agreement on this website: https://hatefulmemeschallenge.com/#download

## Environment Setting
All code experiments were performed using Nvidia A100 GPU provided by Google Colaboratory Pro+ (Colab Pro+). If you want to reproduce my code in Google Colaboratory without changing any file paths, please upload the dataset you downloaded (hateful_memes.zip) along with my code to your Google Drive root directory and then run my code step by step in Google Colaboratory. If you want to run my code locally, please change all of the file paths in my code to your local file paths and install all required packages from the requirements.txt file.

# To Do
Once you start, please go through the following steps to tailor this template to your project

## Thesis report
You may decide to upload your report here directly, or to simply add a reference to where the report is hosted (e.g. Overleaf)
- [ ] Add a reference to the thesis report

## README
- [ ] Add instructions on how to set up the project, how to run your code and what to expect as an output.
